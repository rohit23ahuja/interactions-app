Infuse Idea - Interactions App

Body
Seamlessly interact with your existing application components using natural language, through a single unified interface.
Bring your current applications closer to AI models, harness their capabilities, while maintaining controls.

script - Interactions app allows you to interact with your existing app components using natural language. It also brings your app closer to genrative ai ecosystem while maintaining controls.

Ben stokes
script - Ben Stokes works as an analyst Regulatory surveillance. His daily job involves analysing trades that have been done by bank's traders, to determine whether these executed trades follow trader conduct principles or not. So, he uses documentation to read and understand trader conduct principles, this involves searching and understanding through cast and varied kind of documentation around trader conduct. he also triggers trade ingestion pipelines to ingest trades of the day in his apps database. he writes simple to very complex sequel queries to pull out relevant data from app's database. Based on the fetched data he also creates dashboards to share with other collegues and stakeholders of his team. He normally shares these docs via email. all of this involves interacting with various user interfaces.
In C&I he works in an application that surveills various financial products like equities, fixed income instruments like bonds, foreign exchange. This application runs rules to determine whether any kind of manipulation did happen when the trade was conducted. Ben stokes analyses these financial data and more importantly his job is to monitor alerts. Close false positives and act upon the valid ones. Some times cross product manipulations happen as well.


Interactions App
Interactions relies on LLM capabilities to understand human prompts and translate that into a form that traditional Applications understand. It then returns the result back in an conversational style.

Help me Help Ben
By giving me the opportunity to build Interactions

Points to consider
- Light weight models can be used for data analysis to save costs. especially on non critical environments
- Build generic MCP servers for various DB vendors to expose data
- MCPs for charts and visualizations
- Explore Ollama for non critical environments

1. I am a software developer and I work in a large UK retail bank. I have built a personal project that I need to pitch to my senior management. Your job is to create a 3-4 slide deck that I can use while pitching. I have a running demo prepared already that shows the app running. This slide deck I will use before showing the running app. The app is called interactions. Interactions app allows you to interact with your existing app components using natural language. It also brings your app closer to genrative ai ecosystem while maintaining controls. In my slide deck i INTEND TO use a fictional analyst named as" Ben Stokes", he works as an analyst in the bank. His daily job involves analysing trades that have been done by bank's traders, to determine whether these executed trades follow trader conduct principles or not. So, he uses documentation to read and understand trader conduct principles, this involves searching and understanding through cast and varied kind of documentation around trader conduct. he also triggers trade ingestion pipelines to ingest trades of the day in his apps database. he writes simple to very complex sequel queries to pull out relevant data from app's database. Based on the fetched data he also creates dashboards to share with other collegues and stakeholders of his team. He normally shares these docs via email. all of this involves interacting with various user interfaces .
- Interactions app provides a single interface to ben stokes to interact with various app components and that too in natural language
